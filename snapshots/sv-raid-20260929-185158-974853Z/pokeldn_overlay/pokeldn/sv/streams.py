"""The reliable streams a Scarlet / Violet station runs, and the records they carry.

Measured on a retail pair from the moment the second console associated (sv11). There is no
Session protocol, no Clone protocol and no Reliable 0x7C: the host announces both stations in a
broadcast Net 0x11 and the mesh is those two protocols alone.

    0x80  BroadcastReliable         ports 0, 1, 2
    0x81  StreamBroadcastReliable   ports 0 to 7

Every station acknowledges all eleven about once a second, whether or not anything came on them.
A station opens two of them with an INITIALIZED data message and then sends its records on the port
that is its own station index: the host on 0, the first joiner on 1, which is the convention
`pokeldn.pla.data_exchange` reads for Legends Arceus.

    station          opens                  sends records on
    host (index 0)   0x81 port 1 and 5      0x81 port 0
    joiner (index 1) 0x81 port 0 and 4      0x81 port 1

A record is zlib with a 4 KB window, so its first two bytes are `484b`, and the reliable message
carries FLAG_ZLIB with it.
