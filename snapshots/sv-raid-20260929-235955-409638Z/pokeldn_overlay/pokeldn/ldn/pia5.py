"""Pia 5.27-5.45 packet header - the wire format BDSP speaks.

This is NOT the format `pia_connect.py` speaks. That module targets Pia 6.32+ (header 0x1D, 2-byte
variable ids); BDSP advertises protocol version 9, which the NintendoClients wiki places in the
5.27-5.45 band, and every field below was read off the console's own parser at main.bin 0x01681ee4 rather than taken from the wiki:

    off  size  field                         parser evidence
    0x00  4    magic 0x32AB9864, big-endian  ldr w8,[x1]; rev w8; str w8,[x0,#8]
    0x04  1    0x80 (encrypted) | version    ldrb -> obj+0xc, and (b & 0x7f) == 9 is checked
    0x05  4    destination variable id, BE   ldur w8,[x1,#5]; rev; -> obj+0x10
    0x09  4    source variable id, BE        ldur w8,[x1,#9]; rev; -> obj+0x14
    0x0d  2    packet id, BE                 ldurh w8,[x1,#0xd]; rev; lsr #16 -> obj+0x18
    0x0f  1    footer size                   ldrb -> obj+0x1a
    0x10  8    AES-GCM nonce                 copied byte by byte to obj+0x1b
    0x18  8    AES-GCM tag (truncated)       copied byte by byte to obj+0x23
    0x20  ...  ciphertext (0xFF-padded to a multiple of 16 before encryption)

The 4-byte variable ids are the visible difference from 6.32, which uses 2. `rev` on three fields is
why the header is big-endian on the wire while the struct is not.
